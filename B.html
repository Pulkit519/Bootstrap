  <b>Bootstrap is a free and open-source framework for creating websites and web applications. It's the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first 
  projects on the web.One of the main benefits of development frameworks like Bootstrap is that they can help speed up development times, while maintaining quality and consistency 
  across the site. You no longer need to re-design every element. And you don't need to spend hours trying to get everything looking and working right across browsers, platforms, and 
  devices. By using Bootstrap, all (most) of the hard work is done for you.</b>
